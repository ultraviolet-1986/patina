  - Configuration file `patina_configuration.conf` has been removed from the
    `patina` project directory and all configuration of Patina is now stored in
    the user's home directory as a hidden file named `.patinarc` to follow the
    convention of `.bashrc` or other `.rc` files.

  - Have updated the `patina_system_xdg.sh` file so that the commands `p-url`
    and `p-url <X>` (where <X> is a valid URL) will open a URL in the default
    web browser.
  - The command `p-url patina` will now open the project's GitHub page, this has
    been changed from `p-url-patina`. The `README.md` file reflects this.

  - Patina application component help text has now been moved into plain text
    files for improved proof-reading and updating.
