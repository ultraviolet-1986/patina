## 0.7.x Series: 'Duchess'

### Name Inspiration

The name **Duchess** was taken from the Disney film **The Aristocats**, she is a
mother to three mischievous young kittens and guides them on a long journey home
after an evil butler tries to steal their inheritance.

- **0.7.1 Now testing**
  - A new folder specifically for documentation has been included in Patina's
    root directory and is named `resources`. At present it contains two sub-
    folders named `exceptions` and `help`, these will assist in the organisation
    of documentation to come. Existing documentation has been moved into this
    new structure.
  - There is now a side-project for Patina named *Patina User Components*, it
    can be found at:
    <https://github.com/ultraviolet-1986/patina-user-components>. A user can now
    cherry-pick extra components that add functionality not typically relevant
    to Patina's scope.
  - Three commands have been included to allow quick-access to Patina's new
    `resources` locations - they are `p-r`, `p-r-exceptions`, and `p-r-help`.
    An explanation for these has been added to `README.md`.
  - Sample exception files have been placed within the appropriate directory,
    and a reference list has been added to the new `EXCEPTIONS.md` file along
    with a demonstration of their use in pseudo-code.
  - Improved exception-throwing logic, Patina will now attempt to match a
    specific string. The arguments passed must be in the `PE0000` format.
  - Removed the `p-clamav` alias and edited the `README.md` file to reflect
    this.
  - Updated Internet connection detection so that Patina will now ping
    Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) instead of Google.
  - Drastically simplified `patina_system_updater.sh` code.
  - Removed `p-os` command as it did not provide much to Patina and updated the
    `README.md` file to reflect this.
  - Removed `p-calibrate` command from main repository, placed it within the
    `patina-user-components` repository and updated the `README.md` file to
    reflect this.
  - Have updated `patina_system_theming.sh` to allow colour in text-only
    sessions such as a server (where supported).
  - Support for opening files/URLs has been dropped as a response to KDE Neon's
    security warnings so the commands `p-file` and `p-url` have been removed,
    and the `files` command has been obsoleted.
  - Opening locations such as `p-root` or `downloads` will now only change the
    current folder in the terminal. This can be opened graphically also by
    appending `-g` to the end of the command.
  - Fixed minor bugs with function termination.
- **0.7.0 Released Wednesday, April 4th 2018**
  - Version numbering has been split into three integer variables to introduce
    the possibility of validating a component against a specific version of
    Patina.
  - Removed some of the static-linking logic for now until a better organisation
    logic has been introduced.
  - Application components for `p-ufw` and `p-clamscan` can now access their
    instructions by using `?` as an argument. The commands `p-ufw ?` and
    `p-clamscan ?` are now the same as `p-ufw help` and `p-clamscan help`.
  - Another alias for `p-clamscan` has been added, now the user can type
    `p-clamav` and it (along with its arguments) will operate in exactly the
    same manner as `p-clamscan`.
  - The `README.md` file has been updated to include new command instructions.
  - Both `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` have been parsed with a Markdown linter
    to help better format documentation.
  - The entire project has been parsed, checked and corrected using
    [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

## 0.6.x Series: 'Kyrie'

### Name Inspiration

The name **Kyrie** was taken from the video game **Project Zero (Fatal Frame)**,
during the conclusion of the game, she became the game's ultimate heroine.

- **0.6.9 Released Tuesday, March 20th 2018**
  - Have removed custom prompt functionality to begin the process of improving
    the simplicity of the Patina source code.
  - The script declaration has been changed from `#!/bin/bash` to the more

- **0.6.8 Released Wednesday, January 24th 2018**

    accessed using the `templates` and `public` commands respectively. The
    `README.md` file has been updated to show this.
  - Configuration file `patina_configuration.conf` has been removed from the
    `patina` project directory and all configuration of Patina is now stored in
    the user's home directory as a hidden file named `.patinarc` to follow the
    convention of `.bashrc` or other `.rc` files.
- **0.6.7 Released Wednesday, November 15th 2017**
  - Have updated the `patina_system_xdg.sh` file so that the commands `p-url`
    and `p-url <X>` (where <X> is a valid URL) will open a URL in the default
    web browser.
  - The command `p-url patina` will now open the project's GitHub page, this has
    been changed from `p-url-patina`. The `README.md` file reflects this.
  - The presentation of messages and errors have been altered to remove colours
    and preserve terminal screen estate in the `patina_system_xdg.sh` file.

    amount of empty whitespace shown on message output.
- **0.6.6 Released Wednesday, November 15th 2017**
  - Have included a new component for basic management of the 'ufw' firewall
    named `patina_applications_ufw.sh`. Check `README.md` for updated
    instructions.

    means that most text prompts will be displayed on one line in the default
    colours of the terminal.
  - Patina application component help text has now been moved into plain text
    files for improved proof-reading and updating.
  - The `p-clamscan-help` command has been updated to match the rest of Patina

  - Added Solus' colours to the `patina_system_stylesheet.sh` file.
  - Have added a new Patina Solus theme which can be activated using the
    `p-theme solus` command. Best used with the `p-prompt solus` command.

    [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

    that the source file `patina.sh` is easier to debug and maintain.

    [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).
