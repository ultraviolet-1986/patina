## 0.7.x Series: 'Duchess'

The name **Duchess** was taken from the Disney film **The Aristocats**, she is a
mother to three mischievous young kittens and guides them on a long journey home
after an evil butler tries to steal their inheritance.

- **0.7.6 Released Friday, Septermber 13th 2019**
  - Corrected path variables for the sake of user component
    `patina_user_minecraft`, and allow future components to work with user
    directories.
  - Updated and corrected documentation within `README.md`.
  - Included a new command named `p-uuid`. This command will generate a UUID
    string, which may be copied and used for disk labels, programming
    placeholders, etc.
  - Updated the `p-list` command to make use of `tree` (if present) to display a
    clearer picture of connected components. This is also quicker than the
    previous method. If `tree` is not present, the old component list will be
    displayed instead.
  - Corrected the ability to change directory in either graphical or text-based
    environment.
  - Exported all path variables in `patina.sh` to correct ShellCheck compliance.
  - Included a new component named `patina_applications_timeshift.sh` to allow
    easier management of the creation and restoration of system snapshots. This
    is accomplished by the `p-timeshift` command.
  - Added better detection for whether or not the user's session is running
    under X11, Wayland, or as a headless server environment.
  - Using `p-root` or other change-directory commands should not halt when
    running in a headless server environment.
  - Corrected a 'permission denied' error with changing component permissions
    during Patina initialisation.
- **0.7.5 Released Monday, April 29th 2019**
  - Included `repair` functionality to the `p-clamscan` command to overcome a
    problem encountered under Fedora 29.
  - Included a new component named `patina_applications_libreoffice.sh` to allow
    a user to convert a compatible document into PDF using the `p-pdf` command.
  - An additional two Patina exceptions were added: `PE0011` and `PE0012` which
    help to prevent pre-existing files and folders from being overwritten.
  - Additional ShellCheck tests performed to ensure only required directives are
    present, and that any script errors are caught.
  - Some of the source code has been altered to allow for easier reading and
    debugging.
  - Have changed configuration location to `~/.config/patina/patina.conf` to
    better comply with Linux home directory standards.
  - Included the new component `patina_applications_genisoimage.sh` to allow the
    user to create an ISO disk image using the `p-iso` command. A random string
    will be applied as a disk label. Append `-f` to override ISO-9660
    restrictions.
  - Updated `README.md` to instruct users to clone the repository using HTTPS.
  - Updated `patina.sh` to correct the listing of components and fail if any
    arguments are passed.
  - Updated application header to match current year of release.
  - Included `p-help` command to show `README.md` contents within the Terminal.
- **0.7.4 Released Monday, January 28th 2019**
  - Altered the `patina_throw_exception` function and assigned error output to
    variables stored within `patina.sh`. This will help to improve Patina's
    overall cohesion.
  - Include file `patina_system_gpg.sh` to include new commands `p-decrypt` and
    `p-encrypt`. These use symmetric GnuPG encryption.
  - Force DNF to refresh when upgrading, this will ensure detected updates will
    be installed, but at the cost of increased waiting times on Fedora and its
    derivatives. This can be accomplished by simply using `p-pkg upgrade`.
  - Corrected an issue where the theme would be changed to the default if an
    incorrect theme is requested.
  - Package management has been updated to allow for non-root operation if the
    user is using an **rpm-ostree** distribution such as Fedora Silverblue.
  - Have reinstated the `files` command to facilitate navigation using the
    command-line. This will not require the `-g` command switch and will always
    both change directory on the console and open the location graphically using
    the default file manager.
  - Updated `README.md` to show new command(s) and have updated it according to
    Markdown style standards.
  - The path-detection logic for `files` and other commands such as `p-root` and
    `documents` (for example) have been updated to allow only access to
    directories and not files.
  - A new component named `patina_system_display_server.sh` has been added. This
    allows the user quickly probe the system and determine whether the current
    desktop is running under `Xorg` or `Wayland`.
  - A new Patina Exception has been added, named `PE0010`, it is thrown when
    Patina cannot detect a required variable.
  - Another new component named `patina_system_session.sh` has been added and it
    will contain functionality useful to managing session management such as
    logging out, rebooting, shutting down a system, etc.
  - The commands `p-display` and `p-session` have been added.
- **0.7.3 Released Wednesday, August 8th 2018**
  - Included the initial check and import of the '/etc/os-release' and
    '/etc/lsb-release' files to allow a better interrogation of the host
    operating system. This aids system integration.
  - The source code for Patina now contains the correct license references and
    the terminal output has been updated to reflect this.
  - Version numbering has been reverted to a string for the sake of simplicity.
  - Updated the initial loading message.
- **0.7.2 Released Monday, May 21st 2018**
  - Drastically simplified `patina_system_theming.sh` code by removing `case`
    statements and shifting all logic to the outer `if` tree.
  - Corrected function termination in `patina_system_theming.sh` file so that
    the chosen theme is not applied twice during initialisation.
  - Improved the Operating System detection wall during startup so that it is
    not nesting more code within `if` statements.
  - Loading themes and error-handling themes is now handled by the
    `patina_system_theming.sh` component. This helps to encapsulate
    functionality in a more efficient fashion.
  - Have removed the `patina_system_services.sh` component and updated
    `patina_system_network.sh` to remove its dependency on it.
  - Have removed `patina_system_terminal.sh` and `patina_system_xdg.sh` and have
    moved useful functionality to the main `patina.sh` script.
  - The `patina_system_package_manager.sh` component has been updated to
    detect an Internet connection before beginning.
  - Some functionality has been updated to improve execution times.
  - The entire project has been parsed, checked and corrected using
    [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).
- **0.7.1 Released Tuesday, April 24th 2018**
  - A new folder specifically for documentation has been included in Patina's
    root directory and is named `resources`. At present it contains two sub-
    folders named `exceptions` and `help`, these will assist in the organisation
    of documentation to come. Existing documentation has been moved into this
    new structure.
  - There is now a side-project for Patina named *Patina User Components*, it
    can be found at:
    <https://github.com/ultraviolet-1986/patina-user-components>. A user can now
    cherry-pick extra components that add functionality not typically relevant
    to Patina's scope.
  - Three commands have been included to allow quick-access to Patina's new
    `resources` locations - they are `p-r`, `p-r-exceptions`, and `p-r-help`.
    An explanation for these has been added to `README.md`.
  - Sample exception files have been placed within the appropriate directory,
    and a reference list has been added to the new `EXCEPTIONS.md` file along
    with a demonstration of their use in pseudo-code.
  - Improved exception-throwing logic, Patina will now attempt to match a
    specific string. The arguments passed must be in the `PE0000` format.
  - Removed the `p-clamav` alias and edited the `README.md` file to reflect
    this.
  - Updated Internet connection detection so that Patina will now ping
    Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) instead of Google (8.8.8.8).
  - Drastically simplified `patina_system_updater.sh` code.
  - Removed `p-os` command as it did not provide much to Patina and updated the
    `README.md` file to reflect this.
  - Removed `p-calibrate` command from main repository, placed it within the
    `patina-user-components` repository and updated the `README.md` file to
    reflect this.
  - Have updated `patina_system_theming.sh` to allow colour in text-only
    sessions such as a server (where supported).
  - Support for opening files/URLs has been dropped as a response to
    [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) displaying security warnings regarding
    this so the commands `p-file` and `p-url` have been removed, and the `files`
    command has been obsoleted.
  - Opening locations such as `p-root` or `downloads` will now only change the
    current folder in the terminal. This can be opened graphically also by
    appending `-g` to the end of the command.
  - Fixed minor bugs with function termination.
- **0.7.0 Released Wednesday, April 4th 2018**
  - Version numbering has been split into three integer variables to introduce
    the possibility of validating a component against a specific version of
    Patina.
  - Removed some of the static-linking logic for now until a better organisation
    logic has been introduced.
  - Application components for `p-ufw` and `p-clamscan` can now access their
    instructions by using `?` as an argument. The commands `p-ufw ?` and
    `p-clamscan ?` are now the same as `p-ufw help` and `p-clamscan help`.
  - Another alias for `p-clamscan` has been added, now the user can type
    `p-clamav` and it (along with its arguments) will operate in exactly the
    same manner as `p-clamscan`.
  - The `README.md` file has been updated to include new command instructions.
  - Both `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` have been parsed with a Markdown linter
    to help better format documentation.
  - The entire project has been parsed, checked and corrected using
    [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).
