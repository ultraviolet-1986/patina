# Introduction

*Patina* allows its users to write more efficient scripts and make them
instantly available to their command prompt without the need for sourcing
individually; instead, a user can simply drop their script into the appropriate
folder and execute it immediately. Inspired by the principles behind Kon-Mari,
*Patina* also contains some pre-defined components which can help the user keep
their system clean, tidy and efficient.

# Installation

## Step 1

Clone into the `patina` repository using your BASH shell (example below):

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/ultraviolet-1986/patina ~/Workspace
```

## Step 2

Once the repository has been cloned, you must *source* it in your BASH profile.

This is named `.bashrc` and a sample line can be seen below:

```bash
source "$HOME/Workspace/patina/patina.sh"
```

# Features
Patina is a BASH script with transparent and easy-to-read code, which contains
the following features:

- Compatible with any Linux distribution and Microsoft Windows 10 using the
  Windows sub-system for Linux, requiring only BASH to operate at its most
  basic.
- Provides a means of memorising fewer, shorter commands which will operate in
  exactly the same way regardless of Operating System.
- Contains a unified look-and-feel derived from popular Linux distributions.
- Provides a useful set of basic helper functions for easier script creation.
- Contains a selection of vibrant colour themes to personalise your prompt.
- Provides a means of instantly accessing your scripts.
- Can be restarted to detect and connect new scripts without closing the
  console.
- Contains a dynamic update mechanism using `git` source control.
- Is not intrusive and its own conventions are easy to learn and never replace
  existing functionality.

# Recommended Packages
Patina does not require anything except BASH as a rule, but it can make use of
the following packages (correct for Ubuntu):

| **Package** | **Description**                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `clamav`    | For the `p-clamscan <X>` commands.                   |
| `git`       | For the `p-update` command.                          |
| `systemd`   | For manipulating system services such as networking. |
| `ufw`       | For the `p-ufw <X>` commands.                        |
| `xdg-utils` | For opening files, locations, and URLs graphically.  |

# Conventions
One of Patina's more prominent features is its directory structure - Patina
connects to these directories and the scripts within automatically, acting as a
hub. These scripts are called 'components' - a component requires no execution
code and can simply contain functions that can then be called instantly without
executing the script. An example 'Patina Component' can be seen below:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

hello_world() {
  echo 'Hello, World!'
}

alias 'p-hello'='hello_world'
```

The above file can be saved within the `components/user` folder as
`patina_user_hello.sh` and Patina will automatically connect to it on startup.
A file saved within the `components/system` folder would be saved as
`patina_system_hello.sh` - this is a convention which can help keep components
better organised. This naming convention **must** be followed as far as
`patina_<name>.sh` as a minimum, or Patina will ignore the script and not
connect to it.

The only required code for a component is a function; in this case:
`hello_world`. When starting Patina, you can then simply type 'hello_world'
(sans quotes) to activate your function instead of executing the script and
calling the function externally.

Notice the `p-hello` alias toward the end of the file? This is another
convention of Patina: the `p-` prefix indicates a Patina function and simply
makes for a shorter (yet still memorable) command. This is not a required
convention, but it can be useful to keep your functionality separate from the
rest of the shell and help to prevent naming conflicts.

With Patina version `0.1.0` and later, semantic version numbering is added and
displayed alongside the current version of BASH. This will be in the format of
`Major.Minor.Patch`.

# Patina Layout
The default directory structure for Patina may not be present when cloning into
the repository, but will be generated when Patina starts. The following diagram
demonstrates the intended layout:

```
home
    |
    +-- .patinarc

patina
    |
    +-- CHANGELOG.md
    +-- LICENSE
    +-- patina.sh
    +-- README.md
    +-- components
    |   |
    |   +-- applications
    |   +-- places
    |   +-- system
    |   +-- user
```

This layout is inspired by the GNOME 2 / MATE desktops' custom menu bar, which
contains `Applications`, `Places`, and `System` menu categories respectively -
by mimicking this structure, Patina components can be categorised and better
organised for a user. The additional `user` folder is for any components which
may not fit in the original three categories, or are for testing purposes.

# Built-in Commands

In a similar manner to the component naming convention, Patina includes some
built-in functions, which follow this convention and can be called at any time.
The basic commands are listed below:
