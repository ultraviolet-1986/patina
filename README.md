## Introduction

*Patina* allows its users to write more efficient scripts and make them
instantly available to their command prompt without the need for sourcing
individually; instead, a user can simply drop their script into the appropriate
folder and execute it immediately. Inspired by the principles behind Kon-Mari,
*Patina* also contains some pre-defined components which can help the user keep
their system clean, tidy and efficient.

## Installation

### Step 1

Clone into the `patina` repository using your BASH shell (example below):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultraviolet-1986/patina ~/Workspace
```

### Step 2

Once the repository has been cloned, you must *source* it in your BASH profile.

This is named `.bashrc` and a sample line can be seen below:

```bash
source "$HOME/Workspace/patina/patina.sh"
```

### Step 3

Patina should now be connected. In the header of a new Terminal window, the word
'Patina' should now be visible. Also, the command prompt will change to:

```bash
user@host ~ P$
```

This prompt is split into three components:

1. User name and host name.
2. Current working directory.
3. Command prompt for Patina BASH ('P$' or 'P#' as opposed to '$' or '#').

From this point onward, all Patina commands should now be available.

## Features

Patina is a collection of BASH scripts with transparent and easy-to-read code,
which contains the following features:

- Compatible with any Linux distribution and Microsoft Windows 10 using the
  Windows sub-system for Linux, requiring only BASH to operate at its most
  basic.
- Provides a means of memorising fewer, shorter commands which will operate in
  exactly the same way regardless of Operating System.
- Contains a unified look-and-feel derived from popular Linux distributions.
- Provides a useful set of basic helper functions for easier script creation.
- Contains a selection of vibrant colour themes to personalise your prompt.
- Provides a means of instantly accessing your scripts.
- Can be restarted to detect and connect new scripts without closing the
  console.
- Contains a simple self-update mechanism using `git` source control.
- Is not intrusive and its own conventions are easy to learn and never replace
  existing functionality.

## Recommended Packages

Patina does not require anything except BASH as a rule, but it can make use of
the following packages (correct for Fedora):

- `clamav` for the `p-clamscan <X>` commands.
- `coreutils` for the `p-hash <X>` commands.
- `curl` for the `p-clamscan --repair` command.
- `genisoimage` for the `p-iso` command.
- `git` for the `p-update` and `p-git` commands.
- `gnupg2` for the `p-gpg` commands.
- `libreoffice` for the `p-pdf` command.
- `systemd` for manipulating system services such as networking.
- `timeshift` for the `p-timeshift` command.
- `tree` for an enhanced version of the `p-list` command.
- `ufw` for the `p-ufw <X>` commands.
- `xdg-utils` for opening locations graphically.

**NOTE:** This information may be accessed by using the `p-deps` command.

## Conventions

One of Patina's more prominent features is its directory structure - Patina
connects to these directories and the scripts within automatically, acting as a
hub. These scripts are called 'components' - a component requires no execution
code and can simply contain functions that can then be called instantly without
executing the script. An example 'Patina Component' can be seen below:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

hello_world() {
  echo 'Hello, World!'
}

alias 'p-hello'='hello_world'
```

The above file can be saved within the `components/user` folder as
`patina_user_hello.sh` and Patina will automatically connect to it on startup.
A file saved within the `components/system` folder would be saved as
`patina_system_hello.sh` - this is a convention which can help keep components
better organised. This naming convention **must** be followed as far as
`patina_<name>.sh` as a minimum, or Patina will ignore the script and not
connect to it.

The only required code for a component is a function; in this case:
`hello_world`. When starting Patina, you can then simply type 'hello_world'
(sans quotes) to activate your function instead of executing the script and
calling the function externally.

Notice the `p-hello` alias toward the end of the file? This is another
convention of Patina: the `p-` prefix indicates a Patina function and simply
makes for a shorter (yet still memorable) command. This is not a required
convention, but it can be useful to keep your functionality separate from the
rest of the shell and help to prevent naming conflicts.

With Patina version `0.1.0` and later, semantic version numbering is added and
can be displayed by using the `p-version` command. This will be in the format of
`Major.Minor.Revision`.

## Patina Layout

The default directory structure for Patina may not be present when cloning into
the repository, but will be generated when Patina starts. The following diagram
demonstrates the intended layout:

```text
home
    |
    +-- .config
        |
        +-- patina
            |
            +-- patina.conf

patina
    |
    +-- CHANGELOG.md
    +-- LICENSE
    +-- patina.sh
    +-- README.md
    +-- components
    |   |
    |   +-- applications
    |   +-- places
    |   +-- system
    |   +-- user
```

This layout is inspired by the GNOME 2 / MATE desktops' custom menu bar, which
contains `Applications`, `Places`, and `System` menu categories respectively -
by mimicking this structure, Patina components can be categorised and better
organised for a user. The additional `User` folder is for any components which
may not fit in the original three categories, or are for testing purposes.

## Built-in Commands

In a similar manner to the component naming convention, Patina includes some
built-in functions, which follow this convention and can be called at any time.
The basic commands are listed below:

### Patina Core

```bash
p-help     # Display this file within the Terminal.
p-update   # Check for and apply Patina updates.
p-refresh  # Restart Patina to detect and connect to new components.
p-reset    # Clear command-line history and restart Patina.
```

### Patina Reports

The following commands will display information regarding the current Operating
System.

```bash
p-deps    # Display a list of Patina dependencies and their current state.
p-list    # Display a list of connected Patina components.
p-system  # Display information regarding the current system environment.
```

### Themes

```bash
p-theme default  # Apply light/dark magenta theme.

p-theme water    # Apply light blue/cyan theme.
p-theme --help   # Display instructions for the `p-theme` commands.
```

### Places

#### Home Directory

These locations can also be opened in the default file manager by appending `-g`
to the end of the command, for example: `p-root -g` or `p-c-user -g`, etc. (this
is not required for navigation using the `files` command).

```bash
files                     # Open 'home' folder graphically and change directory.
files "<Directory Name>"  # Open target folder graphically and change directory.
p-root                    # Open the Patina root directory.

p-c               # Open the Patina 'components' directory.
p-c-applications  # Open the Patina 'application components' directory.
p-c-places        # Open the Patina 'place components' directory.
p-c-system        # Open the Patina 'system components' directory.
p-c-user          # Open the Patina 'user components' directory.
```

#### Workspace Directory

```bash
p-gitupdate  # Update 'git' repositories within 'Workspace/git' directory.
p-workspace  # Bootstrap working environment within ~/Documents/Workspace.

p-w      # Open the Workspace directory.
p-w-git  # Open the 'git' folder within the Workspace directory.
```

### Application Components

#### ClamAV

The `p-clamscan --repair` command requires `sudo` privileges, please review
source code before use.

```bash
p-clamscan           # Perform a ClamAV virus scan on a given path.
p-clamscan --repair  # Purge and replace current virus definition database.
p-clamscan --help    # Display instructions for the `p-clamscan` commands.
```

#### Disk Image Creation (genisoimage)

The following command requires the `genisoimage` package to be installed.

```bash
p-iso "<Directory Name>"        # Create an ISO image (ISO-9660 compliant).
p-iso "<Directory Name>" --udf  # Create a UDF image (Non ISO-9660 compliant).
p-iso --help                    # Display help for the `p-iso` command.
```

#### Document Conversion (LibreOffice)

The following command requires the `libreoffice` package to be installed.

```bash
p-pdf "<File Name>"  # Convert a compatible document into PDF.
p-pdf --help         # Display instructions for `p-pdf` commands.
```

#### File Encryption (GnuPG)

The following commands make use of symmetric GnuPG encryption. A pass-phrase is
required to both encrypt and decrypt a file.

```bash
p-gpg decrypt "<File Name>"  # Decrypt a file.
p-gpg encrypt "<File Name>"  # Encrypt a file.
p-gpg --help                 # Display instructions for `p-gpg` commands.
```

The following shortcut commands perform the same tasks as above, without the
need for providing an additional argument.

```bash
p-decrypt "<File Name>"  # Decrypt a file.
p-encrypt "<File Name>"  # Encrypt a file.
```

#### Source Control (git)

These commands will help to perform multi-argument tasks more quickly.

```bash
p-git undo    # Discard changes made to a git repository since previous commit.
p-git --help  # Display instructions for `p-git` commands.
```

#### System Snapshots (Timeshift)

In both cases, the following commands require `sudo` privileges, please review
source code before use.

```bash
p-timeshift create   # Create a system snapshot using 'Timeshift.'
p-timeshift restore  # Restore a system snapshot using 'Timeshift'.
p-timeshift --help   # Display instructions for `p-timeshift` commands.
```

#### Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

In most cases, the following commands require `sudo` privileges, please review
source code before use. Note that this is aimed toward Linux distributions which
provide 'ufw' but do not activate it by default.

```bash
p-ufw disable  # Disable the `ufw` firewall (not recommended).
p-ufw enable   # Enable the `ufw` firewall (recommended).
p-ufw reset    # Enable the `ufw` firewall and reset default rules.
p-ufw setup    # Enable the `ufw` firewall with some basic defaults.
p-ufw status   # Display the status of the `ufw` firewall in a table.
p-ufw --help   # Display instructions for `p-ufw` commands.
```

### Place Components

These locations can also be opened in the default file manager by appending `-g`
to the end of the command, for example: `music -g` or `documents -g`, etc...

```bash
home       # Open the Home directory.
desktop    # Open the Desktop directory.
documents  # Open the Documents directory.
downloads  # Open the Downloads directory.
music      # Open the Music directory.
pictures   # Open the Pictures directory.
public     # Open the Public directory.
templates  # Open the Templates directory.
videos     # Open the Videos directory.
```

### System Components

#### Checksum Management

The following commands will create a recursive checksum dump of all files
contained within the current directory structure. The name of this file will be
the name of the directory followed by a .(hash) suffix; for example:
`directory.sha512sum` or `directory.md5sum`.

```bash
p-hash b2sum      # Create a checksum file using the BLAKE2 algorithm.
p-hash md5sum     # Create a checksum file using the MD5 algorithm.
p-hash sha1sum    # Create a checksum file using the SHA-1 algorithm.
p-hash sha224sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-224 algorithm.
p-hash sha256sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-256 algorithm.
p-hash sha384sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-384 algorithm.
p-hash sha512sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-512 algorithm.
p-hash --help     # Display help for the `p-hash` commands.
```

The following shortcut commands perform the same tasks as above, without the
need for providing an additional argument.

```bash
p-b2sum      # Create a checksum file using the BLAKE2 algorithm.
p-md5sum     # Create a checksum file using the MD5 algorithm.
p-sha1sum    # Create a checksum file using the SHA-1 algorithm.
p-sha224sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-224 algorithm.
p-sha256sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-256 algorithm.
p-sha384sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-384 algorithm.
p-sha512sum  # Create a checksum file using the SHA-512 algorithm.
```

To verify the output checksum file, use the following command(s) depending on
file type you specified:

```bash
b2sum -c "<File Name>.b2sum"          # Verify checksum for *.b2sum files.
md5sum -c "<File Name>.md5sum"        # Verify checksum for *.md5sum files.
sha1sum -c "<File Name>.sha1sum"      # Verify checksum for *.sha1sum files.
sha224sum -c "<File Name>.sha256sum"  # Verify checksum for *.sha224sum files.
sha256sum -c "<File Name>.sha256sum"  # Verify checksum for *.sha256sum files.
sha384sum -c "<File Name>.sha384sum"  # Verify checksum for *.sha384sum files.
sha512sum -c "<File Name>.sha512sum"  # Verify checksum for *.sha512sum files.
```

#### Network Management

The following commands require a `systemd` environment and will prompt the user
for a password, please review source code before use.

```bash
p-network disable  # Disable the networking service.
p-network enable   # Enable the networking service.
p-network restart  # Restart the networking service.
p-network start    # Start the networking service.
p-network status   # Display the status of an Internet connection.
p-network stop     # Stop the networking service.
p-network --help   # Display help for the `p-network` commands.
```

#### Package Management

The following commands may require `sudo` privileges and detect the default
package manager, please review source code before use.

```bash
p-pkg install  # Install package(s).
p-pkg remove   # Remove package(s).
p-pkg update   # Update package catalogue.
p-pkg upgrade  # Upgrade outdated package(s).
p-pkg --help   # Display help for the `p-pkg` commands.
```

#### Desktop Session

The following commands help the user manage their session more efficiently. Note
that the user must be operating within a `systemd` environment.

```bash
p-session reboot    # Prompt the user to reboot their machine.
p-session restart   # Prompt the user to reboot their machine.
p-session shutdown  # Prompt the user to power down their machine.
p-session --help    # Display help for the `p-session` commands.
```

## Helper Functions

The following helper functions can be included in any component or external
script as long as Patina is running:

```bash
echo_wrap "<String>"      # Will echo and word-wrap a paragraph.
to_lower "<String>"       # Will convert text to lower-case and echo.
to_upper "<String>"       # Will convert text to upper-case and echo.
bold "<String>"           # Will convert text to bold and echo.
italic "<string"          # Will convert text to italic and echo.
strikethrough "<String>"  # Will convert text to strikethrough and echo.
underline "<String>"      # Will convert text to underlined and echo.
```

## String Generators

The following commands create suitably formatted strings which may be used for a
multitude of purposes such as passwords, disk labels, programming placeholders,
etc.

```bash
p-date  # Create a timestamp.
p-uuid  # Create a 32-character UUID string.
p-vol   # Create 8-character disk label.
```
